1) somehow test main functions in SLAE.h file:
    write some generator functions TestGenerator
    and test each function for some solutions

2) write Makefile so that
    a) dynamic library can be build
    b) static library can be build
    c) libraries can be placed into users lib directories
    d) include files can be placed into users include directory

3) Divide .cpp with .h files
